# Colour Assignment

  Take the three provided HTML files (do NOT change the file names) and edit the embedded CSS styles to create three different colour schemes.                  Replace everything on each page that is black, grey, or white with a colour from your scheme. There are color, background-color, and border properties that need colours.


# Getting Started

  First download the HTML files from the following link
    https://algonquin.instructure.com/courses/822910/files/56849201/download?verifier=UuGFEvifablykzPosY1d63ZaTIq0bG8Guesn0cw5&wrap=1

# Prerequisites

  Open https://color.adobe.com/ in your browser and choose one of each of the following colour schemes:
   - Monochromatic
   - Analogous
   - Complementary

# Procedure
  
  1. Open the index.html file in your favourite text editor
  2. Change all the black/white/grey colours to any from the MONOCHROMATIC scheme previously selected.
  3. Change the text in the h1 tag to your name and the name of the colour scheme.
  4. Add links to your other colour pages, with a decriptive name.
  5. Repeat accordingly with analogous.html and completementary.html with their respective colour schemes.
  6. Make sure that all your page links work correctly.
  
# Submission

  1. Create a GitHub repo called colours.
  2. Add the gh-pages branch to the repo and make it the default.
  3. Commit your three HTML files to the gh-pages branch in this repo.
  4. Make sure you do not change the names of the files.
  5. Submit ONE of the URLs for one of the pages in the gh-pages area.
  
# *IF any of your links FAIL or the page h1 content is missing the name and colour will get zero for that page. Test your work!
